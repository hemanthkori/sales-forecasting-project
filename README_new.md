# Sales Forecasting Project

This repository contains a simple yet extensible pipeline for forecasting daily sales using a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. It was developed as part of a graduate‑level analytics project and serves as a template for more advanced forecasting initiatives.

## Overview

Retailers often need to forecast future sales to manage inventory, plan promotions, and make strategic decisions. This project demonstrates how to build a forecasting solution in Python using time‑series modelling. It emphasises reproducibility, project organisation and clear documentation.

### Features

- **Synthetic dataset**: A two‑year daily sales dataset generated for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own data for real insights.
- **SARIMA modelling**: Uses `statsmodels` to fit a Seasonal ARIMA model that captures weekly seasonality and overall trends.
- **Reproducible script**: A single Python script (`forecast.py`) reads the data, fits the model and produces a 30‑day forecast.
- **Visualisation**: Produces a plot comparing recent history with the forecast to illustrate model performance.
- **Modular design**: Clear directory structure (`data/`, `output/`, `plots/`) and a `requirements.txt` for easy environment setup.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and create a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemanthkori/sales-forecasting-project.git
cd sales-forecasting-project
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the forecast script**:

```bash
python forecast.py
```

This will read the dataset from `data/sample_sales.csv`, fit the SARIMA model and save a 30‑day forecast to `output/forecast.csv`. It also generates a plot saved to `plots/forecast_plot.png`.

### Customising

- To use your own data, replace `data/sample_sales.csv` with a CSV containing at least two columns: `date` (YYYY‑MM‑DD) and `sales`.
- You can adjust the ARIMA order and seasonal parameters in `forecast.py` to better fit your data.

## Project Structure

```

│   └── sample_sales.csv          # Synthetic daily sales data
├── output/
│   └── forecast.csv              # 30‑day sales forecast generated by the model
├── plots/

```

## Results

The model produces a 30‑day forecast. The plot below shows the forecast (orange) against the most recent 90 days of historical sales (blue):
